# Disclaimer

This repository once cloned is to be opened in Obsidian. 

This repository was made in obsidian and all the notes look best when viewed in obsidian. Once cloned, open this folder as new vault in Obsidian. 

I have converted all the links to markdown, so the repository can be viewed in github, but many features like colors, custom spacing, important highlights will not be rendered in Github markdown.

You can download Obsidian [here](https://obsidian.md/).
