We can see a bytearray in the variable _rsrc_, which is then written to a newly created space and this is then executed.

Copy the bytes to a text editor.

Now remove all the _0x_ bytes and "_,_"

Now save this file as _carved.bin_

Now we can use _scdbg_ to debug this shellcode.

> scdbg.exe /f carved.bin -s -1

We can see it goes to a server _burn.ec2-13-7-109-121-ubuntu-2004.local_ with https and downloads and writes data from the server into a file called _javaupdate.exe_
