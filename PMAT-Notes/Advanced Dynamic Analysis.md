# Advanced Dynamic Analysis 

## Introduction

Here, we will be debugging a malware and understanding the execution flow of the malware when run. This would also give us freedom to control the said execution flow and manipulate it to our convinience.

Types of tools used :
- Debuggers

## Debugging a malware sample

__Binary used__ : _Dropper.DownloadFromURL.exe.malz_

> Program used : _x32dbg_

Load the malware sample onto the debugger.

We can see the debuggers loads us onto the first instruction which is executed when the program is run. It breaks at entrypoint.

Options :

At the above statement we observer the program takes a bit of time, let us set a breakpoint and restart the program.

Once we hit a breakpoint, we can step into the function.

We can observe multiple Windows API calls being made.

We can continue our analysis step by step and go through the flow of execution.
