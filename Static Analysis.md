## Hashing the samples

Use cmder to get the md5sum and sha256 hashes of the sample

#### Packed or Unpacked?

The virtual size is the amount of data on disk when the binary is run. If the size of Virtual Data is way more than the size of the raw data, then it is a packed data.

#### Import Address Table

This gives us a list of [Windows APIs](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Windows_API) being called during the execution of the binary.

[Malapi.io](https://malapi.io/) can be used to find out malicious Windows APIs and their documentation.


#### Key differences between a packed and an Unpacked Binary

1. The Virtual Size and Raw data size will have a huge difference in a packed binary.
2. The _IMPORT Address Table_ will have a lot of APIs which can be clearly viewed in an unpacked binary, unlike the packed binary.
3. Some key components of a packer program, eg UPX, can be seen in PEview.

It also identifies some malicious identifiers from the binary and also grades them in different levels.
